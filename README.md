Our first project aims to capture and quantify the concept of "rhythm" in soccer, focusing on the fluid motion of ball circulation on the pitch. By viewing each individual pass, we plan to delve into how quickly players pass the ball after receiving it, aligning with the team's overall rhythm. The core of the investigation revolves around the "tempo setters," those pivotal players who dictate the game's pace by minimizing their time on the ball, thereby influencing the team's ability to push forward into more threatening positions. The goal is to dissect the correlation between the duration a player holds onto the ball within a team's pass sequence and its impact on advancing the ball into critical zones, aiming for assists or shot opportunities.

For this project the belief is a multilevel model approach where the response variable integrates time on the ball with the distance it travels. This will allow me to identify players who stand out by circulating the ball more efficiently than others, contributing to the team's cohesive flow. Moreover, we're interested in exploring the correlation effects within passing sequences to pinpoint players who synchronize best with their team's rhythm, as well as those who disrupt this flow.

The idea of analyzing the performance trends of MLB players over their careers to identify when players typically reach their peak sounds interesting to me, because it can provide insights into player development, inform team strategy, and influence contract negotiations. The statistical model I can use here would be mixed-effects model where you could account for individual player variability over time and control for various factors that might influence team performance.

The Source can be found from Baseball-Reference because they offer a lot of statistics on MLB players and could be ideal for extracting the data to analyze playersâ€™ career trajectories and performance peaks.
